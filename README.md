My final C project of my coursework, Program Design, where I designed a database that lexicographically orders the t-shirt's organization and sizes indicated by the user input.  
The makefile was created in the student cluster, hence could not be uploaded but was essential for allowing quicker and more scalable recompilation for edits and changes in the dependencies and header files.  
The data structure implementaion for creating the database were with **Linked List**
